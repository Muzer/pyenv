pyenv Environment Unit Tests
----------------------------

This directory contains some "user code" that performs a series of
unit tests against the environment which it is run in.

The steps to run these tests are as follows:

1) Create a robot.zip containing the tests:
   ./make-zip tests robot.zip
2) Put the robot.zip on a USB key and then said USB key into a robot
3) Press the start-button on the robot, and observe that the tests are
   run.

Some of these unit tests use some non-public parts of the API
(i.e. undocumented and lacking any kind of stability guarantee).
These are (and should) only (be) used where necessary.
